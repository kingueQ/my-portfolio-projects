# 🧾 Delivery Notes Management System

This Java-based system was developed to modernize and manage delivery notes and customer data for a local laundry business (Lavandería Plancha Express). It allows for efficient registration, update, and tracking of services, clients, and delivery notes.

## 📌 Overview

Users can:
- Register and manage clients and services
- Create, edit, and delete delivery notes
- Track pending or delivered items
- Generate daily, weekly, and monthly reports in PDF format

This project was my **first real-world application**, developed from scratch—from requirements gathering to final deployment.

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: Java
- **Database**: MySQL
- **IDE**: NetBeans
- **PDF Generation**: iText or similar libraries

## 📊 Features

- CRUD operations for clients, services, and delivery notes
- PDF reports (sales and deliveries)
- Simple but functional GUI built with Java Swing
- Local storage with automatic table creation

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Open the project in **NetBeans**.
2. Update the database connection class with your MySQL credentials.
3. Run the application — it will create required tables if they do not exist.
4. Start managing clients, services, and delivery notes!

## 🔍 Sample Use Cases

- Add a new client with basic contact info
- Create a delivery note with service details and quantities
- Retrieve a report of all services delivered in the last 7 days

## 📝 Additional Notes

- While the UI is minimal, it is intuitive and efficient for daily use.
- This project taught me the full development lifecycle, from idea to deployment.
